# Smart-Prosthesis-Socket-Liner
The Smart Prosthesis Socket Liner (SPSL) was a prototype wearable interfacing system. This system used a multitude of pneumatic solenoid valves to control dependent soft actuators inside a prosthesis socket. Additionally, a low-pressure hydraulic loop was used to remove heat from a user's residual limb. A real-time time-domain acitivtiy classifier was used to autonomously adapt the interface stiffness to suit the catgory fo tasks the user was performing.
