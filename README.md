# Smart-Prosthesis-Socket-Liner
The Smart Prosthesis Socket Liner (SPSL) was a prototype wearable interfacing system. This system uses a multitude of pneumatic valves to control dependent soft actuators inside a prosthesis socket. Additionally, a low-pressure hydraulic loop was used to remove heat from a user's residual limb.
